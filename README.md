# Recipe üçú

Easily define per project or filetype commands to kick off test suits ...

... and have the results land in the quickfix list.

Recipes are automatically loaded from `recipes.json` in the current working
directory. Recipes for common filetypes are preloaded, like build commands.

Pairs extraordinarily well with [qf.nvim](https://github.com/ten3roberts/qf.nvim)

## Setup
```lua
require "recipe".setup {}
```

## Baking üçû
Run a recipe by name by simply

```lua
require "recipe".bake(name)
```

If a recipe of the specified name is not loaded it will attempted to fallback to
a filetype default. This allows generic "lint" or "build" commands.


## Per project configuration
Add a file called `recipes.json` in the working directory and it will be loaded automatically.

Recipes can either be a string specifying a shell command, or a table for
additional options.

Any filename modifiers such as `%`, `<cfile>`, and others will be expanded
before the command is executed, which can be used to execute file specific
commands or opening an HTML file in the browser.

All recipes are a lua table consiting of
  - *cmd* - The command to execute
  - *interactive* - Open a terminal for the process and allow user input,
    useful for running your program
  - *on_finish* - Execute a function by ref or name (as specified in
    `config.actions`)

Use `recipe.lib.make_recipe(cmd, [interactive = false])` to easily create a
command using sane defaults.

### Example
```json
{
  "build": "cargo build --examples",
  "run": "cargo run --example physics",
  "run_term": {
    "cmd": "cargo run --example cli",
    "interactive": true
  },
  "open": {
    "cmd": "xdg-open %:h",
    "on_finish": "loc"
  }
}

```

## Global Configuration
```lua
M.config = {
  -- Configure the terminal for interctive commands
  term = {
    height = 0.7,
    width = 0.5,
    type = "float", -- | "split" | "vsplit"
    border = "shadow"
  },
  -- Specify your own actions as a function
  -- These are then used in `recipe.on_finish`
  actions = {
    qf = function(data, cmd) util.parse_efm(data, cmd, "c") end,
    loc = function(data, cmd) util.parse_efm(data, cmd, "l") end,
    notify = util.notify,
  },
  -- Change the file for looking for recipes
  recipes_file = "recipes.json",
  --- Define custom global recipes, either globally or by filetype as key
  --- use lib.make_recipe for conveniance
  custom_recipes = {
    rust = {
      upgrade = make_recipe("cargo upgrade --workspace"),
    },
    global = {
      open = make_recipe("xdg-open %:h"),
      open_f = make_recipe("xdg-open <cfile>")
    }
  }
}
```

## Security

It is not always a safe to be able to execute arbitrary commands which are
loaded from a file, as is the case for `recipes.json`.

While the user may have created the file themselves, malicious recipes could be
loaded through entering cloned repositories from the internet which have a
`recipes.json`. Malicious intent could also be induced through git when
carelessly merging or pulling others peoples code.

To mitigate this issue, the plugin will ask for confirmation before loading
project local recipes for new projects, or if the recipes file has been changed
outside of Vim.
